This is a repositary of all samples application that can run on RB5. Each sample application has its own folder. An introduction for every sample application is given below. Please follow the README in the respective folders to build, deploy and test. 



## 1. Weston-Client-Application
```
Weston-Sample-code shows how to compile and run a simple client in Weston.
```


## 2. RB5-Information
```
A command based App to get platform information.
from varying target types (GPUs, CPUs, USB, display, sensors and so on).
```

## 3. RB5-Platform
```
A commands based app to get and set GPIO.
For control LED, set GPIO output, Button even catching, etc.
```

## 4. WIFI-On-Boarding
```
WIFI-On-Boarding mainly includes scanning the surrounding hotspots in STA mode, creating a new WIFI connection,
and obtaining the ssid and psk of the currently connected WIFI. After switching the SAP mode, you can create a
new hotspot and get the ssid and psk of the current hotspot.
```

## 5. Tensorflowlite_ROS
```
This application introduces how to integrate Tensorflow framework into ROS with object detection API on RB5 platform.
It can locate and recognize multiple objects in a single image. The TensorFlow Object Detection API is an open source
framework built on top of TensorFlow that makes it easy to construct, train and deploy object detection models.
ROS provides a publish subscribe communication framework to build distributed computing system simply and quickly. Here are the steps to build.
```

## 6. ROS-Caffe
```
Integrate Caffe model into ROS with Classifier API.
```
